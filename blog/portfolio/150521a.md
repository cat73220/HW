####MusiCan####
![](/images/musican.png)

**memo**
: This was made as the promotional item for selling much more their vevarages by their vending machine and used it as their company internal demonstration.
: The idea was when consumer baught drinks by App(iPhone and Android) on vending machines they will get points and the points got limit to be able to have some thing, the vending machine electronicaly send it to this
: This is a mp3 player so the prise of reaching the limit of points was a music into the consumers App.
: This communicated by BLE for transmitting mp3 with App and by RFID for buying drink and getting points with vending machine.

**feature**

  - ARM Cortex-M3 SoC(Fujitsu FM3:MB89BF618T)
  - RFID transmitter/receiver
    - JR Suica or Eddy capablity
  - BLE as Bluetooth Low Enagy with MFi crypting chip
    - Got MFi certificate as experimentation
	- Apple Protcol on BLE
  - MP3 Player

####PaPiPo####
![](/images/papipo.jpg)

**memo**
: Cellular-phone promoted and sold by Bandai Company as a toy phone and used public PHS network and functioned as actual phone.
: Used OOVM as OS made [Lars Bak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Bak_%28computer_programmer%29), Denmark. Smalltalk language was used for system language on OOVM.
: I believe this was the first and only device in the world used OOVM in public
: This is the one of my favorite product ever I was involved developing mainly.
: I developed the most of periperal device drivers on OOVM, graphics, setting UI/UX logics and booting OOVM as OS.
: The hardware was designed and coding the ARM native device drivers with Cs company Japan.
: The apps such as menu system, games were written in smalltalk

**feature**

  - ARM7TDMI
  - ARM SDT(old C Compiler, ARM Assmbler and linker set)
  - PHS-SIM by [willcom network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willcom)
  - smalltalk
  - C++ was used for programming OOVM itself
